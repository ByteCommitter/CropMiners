Crop Classification for India
Introduction
This repository implements various classification methods to determine the best crops that can be grown in different regions of India based on given conditions. The project focuses on utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict suitable crops for specific environmental factors and agricultural conditions.

Methods Used
Pre-Processing of Data:
SVM (Support Vector Method): Quickest Method
PCA (Principle Component Analysis): Reduces Dimensionality
GBM (Gradient Boosting Machine): Best Of Both Worlds
RF (Random Forest Method): Slow, but high accuracy
Usage
Data Collection: Gather data on environmental factors such as soil type, climate, temperature, rainfall, and other relevant parameters for different regions in India.
Pre-processing: Utilize pre-processing methods such as SVM, PCA, GBM, and RF to clean and prepare the dataset for classification.
Model Training: Train machine learning models using the pre-processed dataset to classify suitable crops based on input conditions.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of each model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Prediction: Use the trained models to predict the best crops to be grown in a given region based on the provided environmental conditions.
